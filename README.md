# ColorPicker

A nice color picker using Java Swing that contains a visual color selection and input boxes to enter RGB and HSB values manually.

## Usage

Use the class com.bric.colorpicker.ColorPicker as an entry point. You can easily initialize the panel using

```Java
ColorPicker colorPicker = new ColorPicker(true, true);
colorPicker.addColorListener(colorModel -> System.out.println(colorModel.getColor()));
```

This creates a color picker component with expert controls and opacity settings. If the user selects a color, the color listener will be notified.
